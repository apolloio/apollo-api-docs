# Introduction

Welcome to the ZenProspect API! 

Our API is still in private alpha, is under active development, and is subject to change. Eventually, we plan to make available in the API almost everything you can do in the UI. Additionally, if you have have any suggestions for API methods you'd like to see, please let us know! We would be happy to build it into our API.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: testzenprospectapikey"
```


> Make sure to replace `testzenprospectapikey` with your API key.

ZenProspect uses API keys to allow access to the API. Please contact your dedicated Customer Success Manager for your API key.

ZenProspect expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: testzenprospectapikey`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>testzenprospectapikey</code> with your personal API key.

# Prospect API

## Prospect for People

```shell
curl "https://www.zenprospect.com/api/v1/people/search"
  -H "Authorization: testzenprospectapikey"
```


> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Fluffums",
    "breed": "calico",
    "fluffiness": 6,
    "cuteness": 7
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Max",
    "breed": "unknown",
    "fluffiness": 5,
    "cuteness": 10
  }
]
```
