Welcome to the Apollo API! 

**Our API is still under active development. It is subject to change without prior notice from Apollo.** 

Eventually, we plan to make available in the API almost everything you can do in the UI, plus some extra functionality not available in the UI. Additionally, if you have any suggestions for API methods you'd like to see, please let us know! We would be happy to see if we can build it into our API.
